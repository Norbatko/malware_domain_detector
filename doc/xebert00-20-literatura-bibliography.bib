Originators of Internet Mail need to be able to associate reliable and authenticated domain identifiers with messages, communicate policies about messages that use those identifiers, and report about mail using those identifiers. These abilities have several benefits: Receivers can provide feedback to Domain Owners about the use of their domains; this feedback can provide valuable insight about the management of internal operations and the presence of external domain name abuse. DMARC does not produce or encourage elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email. DMARC is a mechanism for policy distribution that enables increasingly strict handling of messages that fail authentication checks, ranging from no action, through altered delivery, up to message rejection.},

With this increase in users, security became more important. To address confidentiality and integrity requirements on the web, Netscape---by then a major web browser vendor---presented the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), later versions of which were renamed to Transport Layer Security (TLS). In turn, this necessitated the introduction of both security indicators in browsers to inform users about the TLS connection state and also of warnings to inform users about potential errors in the TLS connection to a website. Looking at the evolution of indicators and warnings, we find that the qualitative data on security indicators and warnings, i.e., screen shots of different browsers over time is inconsistent. Hence, in this paper we outline our methodology for collecting a comprehensive data set of web browser security indicators and warnings, which will enable researchers to better understand how security indicators and TLS warnings in web browsers evolved over time.",

In this paper, we take a closer look at TLS 1.3 deployments in practice regarding adoption rate, security, performance, and implementation by applying temporal, spatial, and platform-based approaches on 687M &nbsp;connections. Overall, TLS 1.3 has rapidly been adopted mainly due to third-party platforms such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) makes a significant contribution to the Internet. In fact, it deprecates vulnerable cryptographic primitives and substantially reduces the time required to perform the TLS 1.3 full handshake compared to the TLS 1.2 handshake. We quantify these aspects and show TLS 1.3 is beneficial to websites that do not rely on the third-party platforms. We also review Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) regarding TLS libraries and show that many of recent vulnerabilities can be easily addressed by upgrading to TLS 1.3. However, some websites exhibit unstable support for TLS 1.3 due to multiple platforms with different TLS versions or migration to other platforms, which means that a website can show the lower TLS version at a certain time or from a certain region. Furthermore, we find that most of the implementations (including TLS libraries) do not fully support the new features of TLS 1.3 such as downgrade protection and certificate extensions.},

Typically, before the existence of DGA, the malware was having a hardcoded command and control (C&C) IP address. That hardcoded mechanism is prone to detection and thus how DGA came into existence. Domain Generation Algorithms use the traditional cryptographic principles of Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate a list of domain names to which malware communicates. In this paper, we constructed a list of 44 features (lexical+statistical) from domain names and used the ensemble approaches like C5.0, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and CART to classify DGA domain names. C5.0 stands out as the best one with an accuracy value of 0.9704.}

Domain name system is one of the core components of the Internet, which allows users to type in website names and resolves them to Internet addresses. Several studies proposed using DNS for malware detection, because it is the first step before visiting a specific website. Unfortunately, majority focused on malicious URLs back listing, botnets, top-level-domain, DNS and resolvers. This paper proposes a system to detect malicious domain names, by using eight unique features that accurately identify malicious websites before being visited. We implemented our approach of malicious domain names detection using Python, and experimented with five weeks of real-world data using Weka. The experimental results reports a 77.5\% and low false positive rates 22.4\%. That is very promising considering the approach detect website based on feature calculated based on URL and without downloading the file.},

        abstract = {Abstract The growing number of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the increasing number of situations where partners of a transaction may carry certificates signed by different certification authority (CA) points out the problematic of trust between the different CAs. Several trust models, like the hierarchy model, cross-certification model, and bridge CA model were proposed in order to establish and extend the domain of trust of relying parties (RP). However, each model has disadvantages and especially the scalability in large open networks like Internet. In this paper, we provide users with quantitative information of the confidence a relying party can have about a certificate. We call this information quality of certificate (QoCER). QoCER depends on two parameters which are the quality of procedures announced in the certificate policy (CP) and the quality of CA (QoCA) that represents the evaluation of the CA commitment to its policy. QoCA is calculated based on the recommendation of different actors (audit agency, RP, etc.). QoCER is balanced by another information that represents the confidence on QoCA calculation. We present a formal model of trust to calculate these values. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games and prediction of points in ℝn. We also show how the weight-update rule can be used to derive a new boosting algorithm which does not require prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm.",

        ABSTRACT = {The main goal of the research presented in this paper was to develop a refined machine learning algorithm for industrial tomography applications. The article presents algorithms based on logistic regression in relation to image reconstruction using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and ultrasound transmission tomography (UST). The test object was a tank filled with water in which reconstructed objects were placed. For both EIT and UST, a novel approach was used in which each pixel of the output image was reconstructed by a separately trained prediction system. Therefore, it was necessary to use many predictive systems whose number corresponds to the number of pixels of the output image. Thanks to this approach the under-completed problem was changed to an over-completed one. To reduce the number of predictors in logistic regression by removing irrelevant and mutually correlated entries, the elastic net method was used. The developed algorithm that reconstructs images pixel-by-pixel is insensitive to the shape, number and position of the reconstructed objects. In order to assess the quality of mappings obtained thanks to the new algorithm, appropriate metrics were used: compatibility ratio (CR) and relative error (RE). The obtained results enabled the assessment of the usefulness of logistic regression in the reconstruction of EIT and UST images.},

        abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

        abstract = {Numerous malware families rely on domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish a connection to their command and control (C2) server. Counteracting DGAs, several machine learning classifiers have been proposed enabling the identification of the DGA that generated a specific domain name and thus triggering targeted remediation measures. However, the proposed state-of-the-art classifiers are based on deep learning models. The black box nature of these makes it difficult to evaluate their reasoning. The resulting lack of confidence makes the utilization of such models impracticable. In this paper, we propose EXPLAIN, a feature-based and contextless DGA multiclass classifier. We comparatively evaluate several combinations of feature sets and hyperparameters for our approach against several state-of-the-art classifiers in a unified setting on the same real-world data. Our classifier achieves competitive results, is real-time capable, and its predictions are easier to trace back to features than the predictions made by the DGA multiclass classifiers proposed in related work.},

        abstract = {Encryption is widely used across the internet to secure communications and ensure that information cannot be intercepted and read by a third party. However, encryption also allows cybercriminals to hide their messages and carry out successful malware attacks while avoiding detection. Further aiding criminals is the fact that web browsers display a green lock symbol in the URL bar when a connection to a website is encrypted. This symbol gives a false sense of security to users, who are in turn more likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. The risk of encrypted traffic means that information security researchers must explore new techniques to detect, classify, and take countermeasures against malicious traffic. So far there exists no approach for TLS detection in the wild. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying malicious use of web certificates using deep neural networks. Our system uses the content of TLS certificates to successfully identify legitimate certificates as well as malicious patterns used by attackers. The results show that our system is capable of identifying malware certificates with an accuracy of 94.87\% and phishing certificates with an accuracy of 88.64\%.},
